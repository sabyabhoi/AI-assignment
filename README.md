## Abstract

The primary objective of our project is to optimize the hyper-parameters of a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model for forecasting the prices of a traded stock. The hyper-parameters which are optimized are: the window length and number of nodes in the first and second layer of the LSTM model. The optimization is performed using four different AI algorithms.

## Algorithms Used
